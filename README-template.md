## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind Css
- Postcss prefixer
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google MAterial UI icons


### What I learned

I have learned how to use tailwind css to build a mobile first design which was intriguing considering the amount of time it took me to complete the task. Tailwind css is definetely my go to css framework now


### Continued development

During the project i realized that am not yet comfortable with the sematics HTML especially when using the tailwind css, I find myself reverting to div and span tags, which was frastrating at times. But will definetely look for resources that work with the sematic html and tailwind css.

I found concept of using the postcss prefixer very hard to understand, and that's an area that I've to revisit.


### Useful resources
